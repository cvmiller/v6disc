## Synopsis

A shell script to quickly & automatically discover IPv6 hosts, with the option to ping or run nmap against discovered hosts.


## Motivation

There are three reasons to use `v6disc.sh`

1. Scan an IPv6 network 700,000 times faster than `nmap`
2. Auto Discovery of IPv6 hosts on the network (e.g. for IPAM)
3. Quickly figure out what IPv6 is already on your network.

With 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) potential addresses on a LAN segment, the old brute force method of scanning every address (e.g. with nnap) quickly becomes impractical. Even with version 7 of `nmap`, scanning a /64 still **takes a week**! `v6disc.sh` scans a /64 less than **5 seconds**.

#### MacOS X & BSD support (version 2.0)
MacOS X is BSD based, and does not support the linux `ip` command. By creating a ip command emulator in bash, the `ip` basic show commands are supported on BSD. The script will detect if it is running on a Mac/BSD, and automatically include `ip_em.sh`, the `ip` command emulator script.

#### IPv6 under the hood
Each IPv6 node joins the multicast IPv6 all_notes group (FF02::1), one only needs to ping6 this group to determine which hosts are on the link. Pinging using the host Global Unicast Address (GUA) will yield GUAs in that prefix, including hosts which use DHCPv6. 

As of version 1.3, v6disc no longer guesses SLAAC addresses based on MAC addresses (based on RFC 4862).  The script will also use **avahi** or bonjour (if installed).

With [RFC 7217](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7217) (A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)) the GUA is more random (e.g. Mac OSX Sierra, aka 10.12). Because RFC 7217 GUA addresses are not guessable, `v6disc.sh` uses the local GUA to discover them (as of version 1.3)

If multiple interfaces are detected, script will query each interface, good for running on routers (tested on OpenWRT 17.01.4 & 18.06.1, 19.07.7, & 20.02.1, 22.03.x, 23.05.x)

Some hosts (most notably Windows) will not respond to a multicast ping (to FF02:1). When running `v6disc.sh` on a router, the script will also use neighbour table detection, finding any hosts which send traffic through the router. Use `-n` option to disable neighbour table detection (as of version 2.3)

#### Why Bash?
Bash is terrible at string handling, why write this script in bash? Because I wanted it to run on my router (OpenWRT), and just about every where else, with the minimal amount of dependencies. It is possible to run Python on OpenWRT, but Python requires more storage (more packages) than just bash.

Added colour headings (as of version 1.1) to make output more readable. Colour can be disabled by piping to cat e.g. `v6disc.sh | cat`

## Examples

#### Help

```
$ ./v6disc.sh -h
	./v6disc.sh - auto discover IPv6 hosts 
	e.g. ./v6disc.sh -D -p
	-p  Ping discovered hosts
	-i  use this interface
	-L  show link-local only
	-D  Dual Stack, show IPv4 addresses
	-N  Scan with nmap -6 -sT
	-n  disable neighbour table detection
	-q  quiet, just print discovered hosts
```

#### Using autodetection with OUI lookup (v1.5 or later)

If the wireshark.gz OUI file is present, v6disc.sh will automatically look up the OUI (MAC manufacturer) in the listing

```

To update the OUI database download from [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/data/manuf). Download and process using the following commands, and place in the same directory as **v6disc.sh**:

```
curl https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/data/manuf 
cat manuf | awk '{print $1 $2}' |  tr -d ":" | sed -r 's;(^[ #]+.*);;' > wireshark_oui
gzip wireshark_oui
```


#### Using the Link-Local Option
Don't have a global routable prefix on your network. Still want to see how many IPv6 enabled hosts are ready for the IPv6 network? The link-local option, -L, will print only the discovered hosts (shown with Dual Stack option)

```
$ ./v6disc.sh -L -D
-- Searching for interface(s)
Found interface(s): eth0
-- INT:eth0 prefixs: 
-- Detecting hosts on eth0 link
fe80::129a:ddff:fe54:b634	10.1.1.15

fe80::211:24ff:fece:f1a		10.1.1.12
fe80::211:24ff:fee1:dbc8	10.1.1.14
fe80::224:a5ff:fef1:7ca		10.1.1.1

fe80::a00:27ff:fe21:e445	10.1.1.123
-- Pau
```

#### Discovery with Dual Stack
For those networks which are running Dual Stack, there is an option to print IPv4 addresses next to discovered IPv6 hosts.

```
$ ./v6disc.sh -D

## Installation

Copy `v6disc.sh` into your directory, and run. The script will auto detect interfaces, and run discovery on all IPv6 enabled interfaces.

Copy `v4disc.sh` to the same directory, if you are interested in the Dual Stack option (-D).

Copy `wireshark_oui.gz` to the same directory, if you want MAC OUI lookup enabled.

Copy `ip_em.sh` to the same directory, for MacOS X compatibility (as of version 2.0).

## Dependencies

Script requires bash, ip, grep, tr, sed, sort, cut, awk, ping6 and ping (for Dual Stack). Most distros will have these already installed. `nmap` is required if using the `-N` option. Tested on OpenWRT (17.01.4 & 18.06.1, 19.07.7) after installing bash, ip, and nmap.

If avahi utils are detected, `v6disc.sh` will also use *bonjour* to detect hosts (as of version 1.2)



## Limitations

The script assumes /64 subnets (as all end stations should be on a /64). Discovers only the SLAAC address (as defined by RFC 4862), and does not attempt to guess the temporary addresses. Only decects hosts on locally attached network (will not cross routers, but can run on OpenWRT router).

Dual Stack option only supports IPv4 subnet masks of /19, /20, /21, /22, /23, /24, /25, /26.

The `v6disc.sh` script may *not* discover Windows machines which don't respond to a ping6 to multicast address FF02::1

Although MacOS X is supported (as of version 2.0) FreeBSD is also *now* supported.
